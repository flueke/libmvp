// Ticket mutex system based on

// Note: when using multiple TicketLocks and you want to lock all of them while
// at least one is under heavy contention then it is a bad idea to use
// std::lock which will cause frequent locking and unlocking until all locks
// are acquired. This does not work well with the ticket system.
// Instead write code that locks all of your mutexes in the same order in all
// execution paths.

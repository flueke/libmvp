/* File auto save feature in mvme:
 *
 * Periodically save the vme and analysis configs to disk to avoid losing all
 * changes in case the program should crash.
 *
 * On opening a workspace check to see if an auto save exists and ask the user
 * if it should be loaded or deleted.
 *
 * On closing a workspace the last thing that should happen is removal of
 * existing autosaves. This has to happen after all config files have been
 * saved or the changes have been explicitly discarded by the user.
 *
 * If the user decides to load an autosave clear the filename so that it is
 * treated like a new file and a new name has to be picked
 *
 * or
 *
 * use the autosave name. !!! But this would conflict with the autosave feature
 * itself!
 *
 * Also directly opening an autosave filename could be treated like the
 * autoload (meaning clear the filename) on opening a workspace or it will
 * yield to the open autosave overwriting itself :)

/*
 * Combining filters (draft name) -> Now called ListFilter
 * -------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Input:
 * - Number of words to combine
 * - 16 or 32 bit word length
 * - Word combining: from first word or from last word (natural order or reverse),
 *   destination word is always filled from low bits to high bits
 * - After combining step use a data filter to optionally match certain bits and
 *   for address and value extraction.
 *
 *   Note: as for DataFilter and MultiWordFilter address bits are not required.
 *   the filter will then always yield a single output value with address=0.
 *
 *   Also: address extraction would only really make sense if the filter is
 *   repeated N times. Each repetition would start where the previous filter
 *   left off.
 *
 *   Repeated application of the filter should be handled on the outside. The
 *   number of data words consumed by the filter is known (wordCount) so the
 *   analysis implementation can apply the filter again using the wordCount as
 *   an offset.
 *
 * - Last step: convert extracted value to double. Should a random value be
 *   added? Yes, as it only affects the part after the decimal period which is
 *   not transmitted with the original data.
 *
 * Limits:
 * - input words are 32-bit
 * - intermediate word is 64-bit to allow combining up to two 32-bit or four 16-bit words
 *
 *
 * TODO:
 * - implement single word data filters for u64
 *   Reason: the combined filter uses the member multiwordfilter just to
 *   process the combined u64 by splitting it up into two u32s.
 * - Error reporting
